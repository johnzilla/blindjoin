## Resolved 2026-05-25

- [x] **Integration tests now compile.** Reconciled struct/API drift in
  `tests/integration/full_round.rs` against current `CoordinatorSection`
  (`tor_mode`), `CoordinatorConfig` (`discovery`), and `Client::poll_until_phase`
  (`Duration` arg) signatures. Also fixed a needless-borrow lint in
  `client/src/round/sign.rs` and applied related lints in the integration
  test. CI clippy step upgraded to `--all-targets` so future test-code drift
  surfaces as a CI failure rather than silent rot. Integration tests still
  require a live bitcoind to run; without one they skip gracefully.

- [x] **`cargo audit` CI step is now blocking** (was previously
  `continue-on-error: true`). Documented residual-risk advisories declared in
  `.cargo/audit.toml`, each with a written rationale. `rustls-webpki` bumped
  to 0.103.13 to clear three open advisories.
